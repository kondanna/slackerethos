Hi there &#x1F44B;. My name is Kosi, and welcome to Slacker Ethos. 

I've been living in beautiful Transylvania since quitting my day job at age 33. On a typical day I write stuff, experiment with new recipes, and take walks with my boo &#10084;.

A *slacker* is someone who chooses ease - a state of well-being - by living a low-stress lifestyle and doing work on their own terms. This attitude, or *ethos*, has been the driving force behind my decisions.

### The Four Tenets of the Slacker Ethos

1. Mindful spending

A good practice is to spend money (and time) only on things you value and as little as possible on the things you don't.

The Big Three: housing, transport, and food tend to be life's biggest expenses. 

During my job years I rented a reasonably-sized place, drove a used but reliable car, and learned to make food I enjoyed eating. Living this way has saved me countless time and energy.

It took me many years to figure out what I did enjoy (slow travel), so that's where the majority of my spending goes now.

2. Growing wealth through investing  

Investing scared me at first, but the alternative - not investing, is scarier.

The power of compounding is such that over a lifetime, my investments will make me far more money than I'll ever make working. This money exists to provide a margin of safety and to buy me time to do what I really want. 

Wealth is an inevitable side effect of contentment and disciplined investing.

3. Funemployment - doing work that doesn't feel like work&trade; 

I've always been surrounded by people who hated their jobs. It took me a long time to realize not all work is drudgery, and not all effort is unpleasant. 

It's a luxury to be able to view work as something we choose to do to feel creative, not something we have to do to survive. 

To me, the most interesting kind of work is content creation, because it feels like making something from nothing, and I can do it at my own pace and on my own schedule. 

4. Learning to enjoy the mundane moments 

Much of our time is spent doing mundane and unavoidable tasks, like waiting in line, driving, or doing the laundry. 

Instead of being in a rush, we can radiate feelings of friendliness into the present moment. 

I don't consider myself a spiritual person (whatever that means), but I do believe we humans have the power to generate and sustain feelings of joy and peace, even in the face of boredom and discomfort.

I hope you, too, can find freedom and tranquility in such an approach.
