Welcome to The Slacker Ethos - a treatise on *effective laziness*.

### The Four Foundations of the Slacker Ethos:

1. Being low maintenance

Being cheap to maintain saves money and time. Decide what level of lifestyle is "good enough" and stick with it; today's wants are tomorrow's obligations.

2. Investing with discipline

Money that is saved and invested eventually grows into a life-changing amount.

3. Funemployment - doing work that doesn't feel like work

Living simply and having money buys us more time to do engaging and meaningful things. Like this guy:

> I'd like to live as a poor man with lots of money.

**&mdash; Pablo Picasso**

4. Learning to enjoy the mundane moments

Much of our time is spent doing mundane tasks, like waiting in line, driving, or doing the laundry. Instead of being in a rush, we can radiate feelings of friendliness into the present moment.

I hope you, too, can find freedom and tranquility in such an approach.
