Hi there &#x1F44B;. My name is Kosi. I quit my career at age 33 and since then I've been living in beautiful Romania.

Welcome to The Slacker Ethos - a treatise on what I call *effective laziness*.

### The Four Foundations of the Slacker Ethos:

1. Living a low maintenance lifestyle

Being cheap to maintain saves money and time. Decide what level of lifestyle is "good enough" and stocking with it; today's wants are tomorrow's obligations.

2. Investing with discipline

Money that is saved and invested eventually grows into a substantial amount.

3. [Funemployment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/funemployment.asp) - doing work that doesn't feel like work

Living simply and having money buys us more time to do engaging and meaningful things. Like this dude:

4. Learning to enjoy the mundane moments

Much of our time is spent doing mundane tasks, like waiting in line, driving, or doing the laundry. Instead of being in a rush, we can radiate feelings of friendliness into the present moment.

I hope you, too, can find freedom and tranquility in such an approach.
