Hi there &#x1F44B;. 

My name is Kosi, and welcome to my blog. I call it Slacker Ethos because I hate stressful work and love free time. 

By living like a student and investing as much as possible, I was able to quit my job at age 33. I've been living in beautiful Transylvania ever since. 

Nowadays I have lots of free time to write stuff, experiment with new recipes, and take walks with my honey &#x1F497;. Sometimes I slow travel; my most recent trips were to Spain and Myanmar.

### The Four Foundations of the Slacker Ethos

1. **Mindful spending** is a fancy way of saying living cheaply. 

In this world that we live in, it costs money to merely exist and take up space (it's sad, but I didn't make the rules.) Freedom ain't free, as the saying goes.  

Early on, most of us have to trade our time for money. RIP youth.

Since time is precious, and every dollar I spent on unnecessary things meant delaying my freedom that much longer.

Instead, during my job years, I rented a reasonably-sized place, drove a used car, and learned to cook for myself. What an uncluttered and unstressful way to live!

2. **Investing consistently** can make you more money than you'll ever make working, so don't miss out! 

It may feel risky at first, but not investing is actually riskier, because of inflation (again, I didn't make the rules). 

With some self-education, investing becomes an automatic process that takes very little effort. 

3. **Funemployment** is doing work that doesn't feel like work. 

It took me a long time to realize not all work is drudgery, and not all effort is unpleasant. 

Is there a higher luxury than to be able to work for satisfaction, rather than for survival? #Goals, amirite?

The type of work I'm focused on is content creation. It's free, satisfying, and I can do it at my own pace. 

4. **Not taking things too seriously**, because life is not one magical moment after another, and it's unhealthy to expect it to be.

This world is inherently unstable and insecure - one day our bodies will break down, our achievements will be forgotten, our loved ones will have departed. 

That's a bummer, but it's all the more reason to maintain a lighthearted and unserious attitude. 

As for the mundane and boring moments (like when sitting in traffic or doing the dishes), instead of being in a rush, we can radiate feelings of friendliness into the present moment.

On this blog I will further expand on these points, as well as share tips, insights, and updates on what I'm up to. 

The idea is to have very low expenses, more than enough money, and time to work on fun projects - all the while loving everything else in between. 

I hope you, too, can find freedom and tranquility in such an approach.
