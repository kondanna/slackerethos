Hi there &#x1F44B;. My name is Kosi, and welcome to Slacker Ethos. 

I've been living in beautiful Transylvania since quitting my career at age 33. Day-to-day I work on being a better writer, experiment with cooking recipes, take frequent walks with my partner, and explore ways to do creative work that generate online income. 

I would describe myself as strategically lazy (a *slacker*), and this attitude (or *ethos*) has always driven my decisions.

### The Four Foundations of the Slacker Ethos: 

1. Being low maintenance 

Living cheaply can save money and time - and more importantly, it reduces stress. Call me crazy, but finding of new ways to lower expenses can be a creative endeavor on its own. 

2. Investing consistently 

When savings are invested, it eventually grows into a life-changing amount. Life-changing because it buys us time to do what we want. 

3. Funemployment - doing work that doesn't feel like work 

Living simply combined with life-changing money transforms our perspective on work to something we do to survive to something we do to feel creative. 

(This is something that I suspect will be a lifelong work-in-progress.)

4. Learning to enjoy the mundane moments 

Much of our time is spent doing mundane and unavoidable tasks, like waiting in line, driving, or doing the laundry. Instead of being in a rush, we can radiate feelings of friendliness into the present moment.

The overall theme is to live richly by spending less, stressing less and exploring more. 

I hope you, too, can find freedom and tranquility in such an approach.
