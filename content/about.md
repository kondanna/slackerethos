Hi there &#x1F44B;. My name is Kosi, and welcome to Slacker Ethos. 

I've been living in beautiful Transylvania since quitting my day job at age 33. On a typical day I write stuff, experiment with new recipes, and take walks with my boo &#10084;.

A *slacker* is someone who chooses ease - a state of well-being - by living a low-stress lifestyle and doing work on their own terms. This attitude, or *ethos*, has been the driving force behind my decisions.

### The Four Foundations of the Slacker Ethos

1. Mindful spending

A good practice is to spend money (and time) only on things you value and as little as possible on the things you don't.

The Big Three: housing, transport, and food tend to be life's biggest expenses. 

During my job years I rented a reasonably-sized place, drove a used but reliable car, and learned to make food I enjoyed eating. Living this way has saved me countless time and energy.

It took me many years to figure out what I did enjoy (slow travel), so that's where the majority of my spending goes now.

2. Growing wealth through investing  

I made a habit of consistently investing my savings. This has allowed me to quit my job after nine years.

My investments have given me two things: a margin of safety and free time to do what I want.

Investing may feel risky at first, but not investing is actually riskier. 

3. Funemployment - doing work that doesn't feel like work&trade; 

It took me a long time to realize not all work is drudgery, and not all effort is unpleasant. 

It's a luxury to be able to see work as something we choose to do, not something we have to do to survive. 

Right now, I'm focused on content creation, because it feels like making something from nothing, and I can do it on my own schedule. 

4. Learning to enjoy the mundane moments 

Much of our time is spent doing mundane and unavoidable tasks, like waiting in line, driving, or doing the laundry. 

Instead of being in a rush, we can radiate feelings of friendliness into the present moment. 

I don't consider myself a spiritual person (whatever that means), but I do believe we humans have the power to generate and sustain feelings of joy and peace, even in the face of boredom and discomfort.

I hope you, too, can find freedom and tranquility in such an approach.
