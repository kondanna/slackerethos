Hi there &#x1F44B;.

My name is Kosi and I've been [funemployed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/funemployment.asp) since the age of 33. I thought things were all set. What now? Did I make a mistake? I was a bit lost, existential dread, so I started writing to organize my thoughts and figure out what was going on. (writing forces exploration). Reflection: I didn't have a burning ambition to save the world.

Here's what I came up with:

four foundations of the slacker ethos:

(it all comes down to saving time and energy to pursue meaningful things. too often we work, then zone out afterwards, and the cycle repeats.)

living lightly / thoughtfully - being low maintenance - as close to self-sufficient as possible. expenses are future obligations. the sooner I decided what I had was 'good enough' - the quicker the relief.

investing regularly with discipline and stoicism with the savings from a low-maintenance lifestyle.

funemployment - doings meaningful activities (work that doesn't feel like work) - build a cabin, physical labor, teach high school math. writing organizes my thoughts and hopefully the reader's.

loving the present moment / daily activities - even with lots of free time, we have a tendency to rush and get things over with. much of life is pretty neutral - not super exciting nor painful. waiting in lines, doing laundry, dishes, traveling. maybe unpleasant tasks or work is a bummer. i watch my mind and notice if i'm in a rush, trying to get something over with. then radiate some friendliness into the present.

this type of lifestyle is pretty conducive to writing.

they support each other!

we avoid unnecessary busy-ness. mental burden.

I wasn't born rich - I just kept my expenses as low as possible and invested consistently.

At first, living simply was a necessity, as I was a poor college student. So it felt like deprivation at first.

But even after graduating and finding a job, I learned to enjoy the lifestyle, especially after realizing it led to more free time with less stress.

When I saw the relationship between spending, free time, and stress...

Then it becomes a side effect of money not being able to buy what really matters.

Afterwards, I enjoyed the lifestyle, and it kind of became a habit. The pursuit of external stimulus and excess comfort wasn't very interesting. The pursuit of making more money would fade over time as well.

What it looked like was: the cycle of needing to make more... spending time.. throwing more money to save time... It's better to be organized and intentional and thoughtful. All that angst and seriousness, and for what! What a waste of time. Perhaps this was an oversimplification, with a grain of truth. It's hard to know what's going on in people's heads, even my own.

After I felt set, I felt even less pressured to make status purchases, as there was nothing to prove. The priority was to find engaging and challenging projects to work on. You can't really buy that.

Seeing others consistently make big purchases, fill their schedule with activities, but being stressed I never experienced FOMO.

You need some money to sustain your hobbies - hopefully it's not yachting or gambling.

Fancier tastes are more difficult to sustain both mentally and financially.

It's a more peaceful perspective, rather than being overwhelmed then underwhelmed, overstimulation and boredom.

I assume the dude's got creative pursuits.

I hope you, too, can find bliss and tranquility in such a path. And refreshing read.

Nowadays, I am practicing writing and calisthenics while living in beautiful Romania.

Why slacker ethos? Motto:

By itself, it is a very broad statement that's not very helpful.

Perhaps I use it to justify my lack of worldly ambition.

Once you have enough, it's silly to keep doing things you don't want to do just to make money. "Enough" can be approached faster if lower upkeep.

I want to avoid doing things I don't want to do, and do more of things I want

spending is so easy to do (just takes one click) yet so much work to maintain.

before buying: is this a long-term thing i'll use a lot?
